# Football Analysis using YOLO

This project employs YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection to conduct comprehensive analysis of football matches. The goal is to provide detailed insights into player performance, team dynamics, ball possession, and camera movements during a match.



## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AyushKumar1810/FOOTBALL-LEARNING
   cd football-analysis-using-yolo
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

The following libraries are used in this project:

- ultralytics
- numpy
- opencv-python
- roboflow
- pandas
- pickle
- supervision
- shutil
- scikit-learn

## Usage

1. **Data Preparation:**

   - Place your video footage of the football match in the `input` directory.

2. **Running the Analysis:**

   - Execute the main script `python main.py` to initiate the analysis process.
   - The analysis encompasses the following key steps:
     - Object tracking using YOLO for players, referees, and the football.
     - Estimating camera movements to understand viewpoint changes.
     - Calculating player speed, distance traveled, and determining ball possession.
     - Visualizing analysis results on the video frames.

3. **Output:**
   - The annotated and analyzed video will be saved in the `output_videos` directory for review.

## Code Structure

- **`utils.py`**: Contains utility functions for video I/O operations.
- **`trackers.py`**: Implements the YOLO-based object tracker and interpolation techniques.
- **`team_assigner.py`**: Assigns teams to players based on their visual appearance.
- **`player_ball_assigner.py`**: Determines ball possession among players during the match.
- **`camera_movement_estimator.py`**: Estimates camera movements to analyze perspective changes.
- **`view_transformer.py`**: Transforms object positions based on the camera view for accurate analysis.
- **`speed_and_distance_estimator.py`**: Calculates player speeds and distances traveled for performance evaluation.
